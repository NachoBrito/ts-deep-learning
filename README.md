# Neural Network written in Typescript 

I read Douglas Reiser's article and decided to replicate the project doing my own implementation of a Deep Neural Network with Typescript.

Obviously the oerformance is terrible compared to other languages, but the purpose of this project was to experiment and gain a deeper understanding of the internal work of Neutral Networks.

If you're new to this topics, I recommend this resources to understand the ideas behind them:
